Some goals:
	- Have doorbells on separate pages (configurable stride?)
	- Provider can evolve the medatata header (e.g., virtio-net)
	  to balance between the needs of FreeBSD and Linux.
	  (virtio-net is good for Linux, but not for FreeBSD).

TODO:
	- A command register to stop/start the device (or maybe
	  part of the feature negotiation mechanism ?)
	- Two more programs to reclaim pending buffers (only
	  when the device is stopped).
