Some goals:
	- Have doorbells on separate pages (configurable stride?)
	- Provider can evolve the medatata header (e.g., virtio-net)
	  to balance between the needs of FreeBSD and Linux.
	  (virtio-net is good for Linux, but not for FreeBSD).
        - Virtio 1.1 vs 1.0 (while 0.95 is still around). This is a
          sign that there is a need for evolution and compatbility
          problems.

TODO (driver):

TODO (qemu):
        - Replace cpu_physical_memory_[un]map() with dma_memory_[un]map()
          and the MemoryRegionCache library. This should be only necessary
          if the guest platform has an IOMMU.
          Code in virtqueue_pop() and virtqueue_push().
